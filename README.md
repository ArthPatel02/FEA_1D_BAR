# FEA - 1D Bar Simulator

## Project Description üí°
### $${\color{lightblue}Problem \space\space Statement}$$
- Develop a code/software to solve a general 1-dimensional axially loaded bar. The schematic of a bar with concentrated and distributed loads is shown in figure for your reference.

### Input Requirements :
1. Arbitrary number of sections* of any length, cross-sectional area (A), and elastic modulus (E).
2. Fixity (u = 0) at any location.
3. Arbitrary uniform distributed and concentrated loads.
4. Mesh refinement option in terms of number of elements.
   
### Output Details :
1. Primary unknown (axial displacements, u).
2. Secondary unknown (stress).
3. Graph of both variables along coordinate axis.

  > *A section is defined as the portion of the bar where AE remains constant in this context.
